        Dynamically discovers dimension structure from product metadata rather
        than assuming a fixed dimension order.  Dimension names are matched
        with fuzzy keywords (e.g. "sex" -> Gender, "age" -> Age group) so the
        method works for *any* product, not just the population table.

        Args:
            params: Dictionary containing:
                - productId: Product ID to query (e.g., "17100005" for population)
                - indicator: Human-readable indicator name (e.g., "Population")
                - periods: Number of recent periods to fetch (default: 20)
                - dimensions: Dict mapping dimension names to values, e.g.:
                    {
                        "geography": "Ontario",
                        "gender": "Men+",
