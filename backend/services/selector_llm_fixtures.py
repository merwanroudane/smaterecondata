"""Recorded selector-LLM fixtures (offline test determinism).

The indicator selector's Step-2 adjudication (`IndicatorSelector._llm_pick`)
POSTs a fully-rendered prompt to a chat-completions endpoint and consumes the
raw response `content` string. That single network hop is the last source of
non-determinism in the offline suite once query embeddings are replayed
(`embedding_retrieval` fixtures). This module records real responses and
replays them verbatim so selector tests run with no network at all.

Contract (mirrors `embedding_retrieval`'s query-embedding fixtures):

  env `SMATECONDATA_SELECTOR_FIXTURES`:
    "replay" -> look the recorded response up by (model, prompt). A miss raises
                KeyError naming the query and the exact re-record command —
                never a silent default, so an un-recorded prompt is a
                diagnosable failure, not a masked one.
    "record" -> call happens live; the caller feeds the real response here to
                be appended/overwritten.
    unset    -> live behavior, no fixture I/O.

Key derivation: sha256(model + "|" + whitespace-normalized prompt).

  Why normalize whitespace in the KEY (only): the prompt is machine-rendered
  and otherwise deterministic — it interpolates the user query, provider, and
  the enriched candidate `options` block, none of which carry a wall-clock
  date, timestamp, or random ordering (the one data-derived field,
  "last data: <end_date>", comes from the static local indicator DB, not the
  clock). The only realistic churn is another maintainer reflowing the
  LLM_SELECTION_PROMPT template's indentation or blank lines. Collapsing runs
  of whitespace means such a purely cosmetic edit keeps the key stable and the
  recorded decision still replays — while any change to the actual prose or the
  candidate set changes the key, misses, and forces an honest re-record. Case
  and token order are preserved: those change the LLM's decision, so folding
  them would let one recording stand in for a genuinely different prompt.
