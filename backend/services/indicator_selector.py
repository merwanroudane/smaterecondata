"""
Indicator Selector — retrieval + LLM adjudication for ALL 330K indicators.

Architecture (decided 2026-04-01):
  Step 1: FTS5 + embedding retrieval → find candidate indicators
  Step 2: LLM picks, asks, or rejects the candidate set

No catalog injection or provider-code shortcut maps. Retrieval supplies the
candidate evidence; the LLM adjudicates the user's requested measure.

LLM_SELECTION_PROMPT = """You are selecting the best economic indicator for a user's data query.

User query: "{query}"
Data provider: {provider}

Available indicators (numbered):
{options}

INSTRUCTIONS:

A query like "unemployment" clearly means the GENERAL/TOTAL unemployment rate.
Variants like "youth unemployment", "female unemployment" are SUBSETS — they are
NOT what the user meant unless they explicitly asked for them.

Only consider the query AMBIGUOUS when there are genuinely DIFFERENT MEASURES of
the same concept that the user might want. For example:
- "health spending" is ambiguous: % of GDP vs per capita vs absolute dollars
- "GDP" is ambiguous: current US$ vs constant dollars vs PPP
- "unemployment" is NOT ambiguous: it means the total rate

DECISION:
- Try to PICK one indicator when the candidate list contains a semantically valid answer.
- Use REJECT when NONE of the provided candidates answer the requested measure.
- Only use ASK when the user's query EXPLICITLY asks about something that has
  fundamentally different measurement approaches (e.g., "health spending" could
  be % of GDP OR per capita — genuinely different numbers).
- Single-word or broad queries like "GDP", "trade", "energy" should PICK the
  most standard version, NOT ask the user.
- Do NOT REJECT just because the query is broad. REJECT only when all candidates
  are clearly about different concepts, populations, geographies, frequencies,
  or units than the user's requested measure.

Reply with one of:
- "PICK: <number>" when a candidate answers the query.
- "ASK: <number>,<number>,..." when the user must choose between genuinely
  different measurement approaches.
- "REJECT: <short reason>" and "SEARCH: <alternative search terms>" when no
  candidate answers the requested measure.

Defaults for broad queries:
- "GDP" → GDP current US$ (most standard)
- "trade" → trade (% of GDP)
- "energy" → energy use per capita or total
- "emissions" → CO2 emissions total
- "education" → school enrollment primary
- "agriculture" → agriculture value added (% of GDP)
- "manufacturing" → manufacturing value added (% of GDP)

CRITICAL RULE — Match the MEASURE TYPE the user asked for:
- "inflation rate", "growth rate", "year-over-year change", "% change" → the
  candidate must itself BE a rate/percent-change series (unit like "Percent",
  "Annual %", "% change"). An index LEVEL (unit like "Index 1982-84=100") or a
  currency LEVEL is NOT the requested measure — never PICK a level series when
  the user asked for a rate, even if its name mentions the same concept.
- Conversely, "CPI", "price index", "GDP" with no rate wording → a level/index
  series is the correct answer.
- Use each candidate's unit/metadata shown in parentheses to decide. If no
  candidate carries the requested measure type, REJECT and put the measure in
  the SEARCH terms (e.g. "consumer price inflation annual percent change").

CRITICAL RULE — Match specificity of answer to specificity of question:
- "unemployment rate" → NATIONAL/AGGREGATE (never county or MSA level)
- "unemployment rate Florida" → STATE level Florida
- "unemployment rate Sarasota County" → COUNTY level (user was specific)
- If the user did NOT mention a state/county/city, NEVER pick a geographic sub-unit.
- If the user did NOT mention "female", "youth", "male", ALWAYS pick "total".
- If the user did NOT mention "seasonally adjusted" or "NSA", prefer seasonally adjusted.
- The answer should NEVER be more specific than what the user asked for.

CRITICAL RULE — Frequency matching:
- If the user query contains "monthly" / "month" → MUST pick a series with
  frequency=monthly (e.g., une_rt_m, not une_rt_a).
- If the user query contains "quarterly" / "quarter" → MUST pick frequency=quarterly.
- If the user query contains "annual" / "annually" / "yearly" → prefer frequency=annual.
- If the user query contains "daily" → prefer frequency=daily.
- If the user query contains "weekly" → prefer frequency=weekly.
- A monthly variant is BETTER than annual when monthly is requested, even if the
  annual variant has a slightly more popular code.  Frequency match is a HARD
  constraint, not a preference.
- If no frequency-matching candidate exists, fall back to the closest available
  (e.g., monthly if no daily exists), and note "frequency unavailable" in reasoning.

Selection rules:
- NEVER pick a DISCONTINUED series when active alternatives exist
- Prefer ACTIVE (recent data) over DISCONTINUED/OBSOLETE series
- When one candidate is marked "MOST-USED series for this concept", pick it
  for plain-concept asks unless the user explicitly requested a variant
  (a sub-population, a different adjustment, a specific source).
- NEVER pick an experimental/research/model-based index (e.g. names containing
  "index", "experimental", "tracker", "nowcast", or a research-team brand) over
  the OFFICIAL headline measure of the same concept when both are candidates —
  the user asking for a plain concept wants the official statistic.
- Prefer NATIONAL/AGGREGATE over state/county/MSA/regional variants
- Prefer TOTAL over demographic subsets (female, male, youth, elderly)
- For direct count/number/total requests, prefer an indicator that measures the
  requested entity count directly. Do not pick distribution, ratio, subset,
  account-allocation, or breakdown tables unless the user explicitly asks for
  that narrower measure.
- Prefer SEASONALLY ADJUSTED over not adjusted (NSA)
- Prefer modeled ILO estimates (SL.*) over Jobs Indicators (JI.*)
- Prefer % of GDP over absolute values for cross-country comparison
- Prefer gross enrollment over net unless user specifies "net"
- Prefer SHORTER/SIMPLER indicator codes when concepts are identical
- Prefer the most GENERAL version — never pick a more specific variant than asked

FRED-specific rules for near-identical series:
- Flow of Funds codes (BOGZ1F...): prefer L (Level) over R (Revaluation),
  A (Transactions), U (Volume changes). Users want LEVELS unless specified.
- When two codes differ only by trailing letters (Q vs A, SA vs NSA, MM vs YY):
  prefer the STANDARD version (SA, Annual, or the shorter code)
- "Total Private" is more general than "Construction" or other industry subsets
- Prefer US Dollar denomination over other currencies unless user specifies

When in doubt between valid variants, PICK the most general — the user can
always ask for a variant. When none are valid, REJECT and provide better SEARCH
terms."""

            exclude_codes: Provider codes to drop from the candidate set before
                adjudication. Used by the same-provider alternate-retry path:
                when an LLM-picked code returns no data, re-adjudicating with it

                ``query`` (case-insensitive), the retrieval runs an ADDITIONAL
